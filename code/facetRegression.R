# I would like to annotate ggplot2 with a regression equation and r squared.
# Ideally, it would work for facets and the location of the annotation could be
# conveniently specified (e.g. "topleft"). Maybe itâ€™s just my ignorance but
# there seems to be no specific function in ggplot2 package to achieve this.
# This is surprising to me because displaying r squared, slope and intercept
# in the plot is quite common and informative. Having the option to display
# model coefficients and R2 as plot annotation would be a great extension
# of geom_smooth() or stat_smooth() functions, even if it worked for lm
# method only.

# I found the following answers to a similar question on Stack Overflow and
# RPubs, but the solutions are not so straightforward (problems with facets,
# positioning).

# Do you guys have any recommendations of how to add model information to the

# Many thanks!
