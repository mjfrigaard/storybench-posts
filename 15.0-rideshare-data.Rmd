## The data

<!-- Describe data set (high-level, minimal EDA and wrangling description (refer to scripts on Github) -->


Recently the City of Chicago released  rideshare data with details at the ride level beginning November 2018. Check out the write up on these data [here](https://chicago.curbed.com/2019/4/15/18311340/uber-lyft-chicago-data-fares-drivers) and download them [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p).

As a former Lyftee working in data science to support engagement and acquisition solutions, these data presents an opportunity to explore how an analytics mindset can be leveraged to make evidence-based recommendations to real business problems. 

At the rider level, Lyft is fundamentally a service platform that delivers transportation solutions to passengers. People use the app on their mobile devices to order rides. 

The more frequently Lyft can deliver passengers relevant messaging in the right place and at the right time, they can gain an incremental portion of a passenger’s total transportation budget. Being the right app at the right time means people will use Lyft to get from A to B. 

Passenger behavior--at the ride level--can reveal insights about a users engagement with Lyft that marketers and product teams can uncouple to build insight based marketing programs. In short, learning more about customers to bring them a useful product. 

### Import

These files are huge, so we took a 10% sample. We also removed all missing data because some rides occurred outside Chicago. Read more about this in the data dictionary [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p).


```{r pickup-centroid-latitude, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/pickup-centroid-latitude.png")
```

```{r import, eval=FALSE}
# read ride data
rides <- readr::read_csv("Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips.csv.crdownload") %>%
  dplyr::sample_frac(size = .1)
```

```{r small-import-rides.chicago, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("data")
rides <- readr::read_csv("data/rides.chicago.csv")
```

### Wrangle

The trip start and end times came into RStudio as factors, with AM and PM in 12-hour format. These needed to be converted to dates in a 24-hour format, in a local timezone. We also created ride hour, day of the week, week, and date variables for the trips. 

```{r wrangle}
# filter for only Chicago rides
# Based on our data dictionary Pickup.Centroid.Latitude will be left blank for
# locations outside Chicago
rides.chicago <- rides %>%
  tidyr::drop_na()

# rides.chicago %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)

# drop original data for convenience
# rm(rides)

# convert 12 hour format to 24 hr format and extract date features of our
# ride events
rides.chicago$ride_start <- as.POSIXct(rides.chicago$Trip.Start.Timestamp,
  format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p",
  tz = "America/Chicago"
)

# create ride_hour, dow, weekday, week, date_week, trip.mins
rides.chicago$ride_hour <- lubridate::hour(rides.chicago$ride_start)
rides.chicago$dow <- base::weekdays(rides.chicago$ride_start)
rides.chicago$week <- lubridate::week(rides.chicago$ride_start)

rides.chicago$date_week <- as.Date(cut(rides.chicago$ride_start, "week"))
rides.chicago$trip.mins <- as.Date(cut(rides.chicago$ride_start, "week"))


# create category for each ride's time of day
rides.chicago <- rides.chicago %>%
  mutate(
    ride_category =
      case_when(
        ride_hour >= 5 & ride_hour <= 10 ~ "morning commute",
        ride_hour > 10 & ride_hour <= 12 ~ "late morning",
        ride_hour > 12 & ride_hour <= 17 ~ "afternoon",
        ride_hour %in% c(18, 19) ~ "evening commute",
        ride_hour %in% c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24) ~ "night life"
      )
  )

# set levels for ride_category
rides.chicago$ride_category <- factor(rides.chicago$ride_category,
  levels = c(
    "morning commute",
    "late morning",
    "afternoon",
    "evening commute",
    "night life"
  )
)

# set levels for day of week
rides.chicago$dow <- factor(rides.chicago$dow, levels = c(
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday"
))

# create tippers and non-tippers
rides.chicago <- rides.chicago %>% # count(Tip)
  dplyr::mutate(
    tipper =
      case_when(
        Tip == 0 ~ "no tip",
        TRUE ~ "tip"
      ),
    tipper = factor(tipper)
  )
```

### Visualize

We like to start by visualizing the *entire* dataset to ensure there isn't any corruption, missing data, etc. The three packages that are great for this are `skimr`, `visdat` and `inspectdf`. All three packages come with a slew of functions for visualizing your data set and underlying variable distributions.

```{r eda-packages}
library(skimr)
library(visdat)
library(inspectdf)
```


```{r inspect_na}
# check for NAs
inspectdf::inspect_na(rides, show_plot = TRUE)
```

```{r inspect_types}
# summarize data types
inspectdf::inspect_types(rides, show_plot = TRUE)
```



## The problem 

<!-- If-then statement is created from EDA and contextual knowledge about the business.  -->

Lyft can increase long term value (LTV) and share of passenger transportation budget by targeting high intent times where passengers are most in need of rides. For instance, these might be communting to and from work, of going out at night on the weekend. 

Meeting passengers with timely messaging and personal solutions presents a measurable opportunity to increase LTV. 

### Visualize the trips by hour of the day

We know we want to see trips across *at least* two levels (day or the week, and time of the day). The visualization below displays the number of trips taken per hour of the day across the days of the week. 

Specifically, the `rides.chicago` data frame is piped (`%>%`) over to the `ggplot2` functions to create histograms, and then faceted by the days of the week to show the rides-per-hour breakdown across each day. 

```{r ggRideCountPerHour}
library(ggthemes)
# trips by hour of day
ggRideCountPerHour <- rides.chicago %>%

  ggplot(aes(x = ride_hour)) +

  geom_bar() +

  facet_grid(~dow) +

  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +

  theme(axis.title = element_text()) +

  labs(
    title = "Rideshare Rides By Hour of Day",

    x = "Hour of Day",

    y = "Trip Count"
  ) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    size = 8,

    angle = 90
  ))

ggRideCountPerHour
```


# Tips by ride duration

The scatterplot below shows the tips given at different trip durations. We can sample our data using `dplyr::sample_frac()` function from for a more manageable data set. We group these data by the two variables of interest (`tipper` and `ride_category`), then create a mean of the trip duration (`mean_trip_mins`) for a more interpretable visualization across these groups.

```{r mean-trip-duration-tipper}
rides.chicago %>%
  # create trip_mins
  mutate(trip_mins = (Trip.Seconds / 60)) %>%
  # get sample
  dplyr::sample_frac(size = .05) %>%
  # group by two variables of interest
  group_by(tipper, ride_category) %>%
  #
  summarize(
    mean_trip_mins = mean(trip_mins),
    rides = n()
  ) %>%
  # ungroup
  ungroup() %>%

  ggplot(aes(
    x = mean_trip_mins,

    y = ride_category,

    label = rides
  )) +

  geom_line(aes(group = ride_category),
    color = "gray50"
  ) +

  geom_point(aes(color = tipper),
    size = 1.5
  ) +

  geom_text(aes(label = rides), nudge_y = 0.2, size = 3) +

  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +

  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10)) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45)) +

  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Average trip in minutes",

    y = "Time of day",

    title = "The Ride time gap",

    subtitle = "difference in average trip times by tippers"
  )
```

## What did we learn?

Motivating passengers to engage in tipping is another source of payment that benefits drivers. Although tipping is clearly less common than not tipping, this is an avenue where learning more about the factors incluencing tip behaviors could potentially be used to increase the engagement between passengers and their rider experience.

## Tipping and Ride Duration 

For riders who do tip, we want to know what the relationship is between the amount of the tip and the duration of the ride. The graph below displays these two variables across time of day. 

```{r ggTipsRideDuration}
# tips by ride duration
ggTipsRideDuration <- rides.chicago %>%
  # get sample
  dplyr::sample_frac(size = .05) %>%
  # remove people who didn't tip at all
  dplyr::filter(tipper == "tip") %>%
  # create a trip.mins for converting duration of secs to mins
  mutate(trip.mins = (Trip.Seconds / 60)) %>%
  # plot Tip by trip.mins
  ggplot(aes(
    x = trip.mins,
    y = Tip,
    # color = tipper,
    group = ride_category
  )) +
  # points
  geom_point(aes(color = ride_category),
    alpha = 1 / 2,
    size = 0.7,
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  # facet by ride_category
  facet_wrap(~ride_category,
    ncol = 3,
    scales = "free_x"
  ) +
  # add linear smoothing line
  stat_smooth(
    se = TRUE,
    col = "blue"
  ) +

  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +

  theme(axis.title = element_text()) +

  labs(
    title = "Rideshare Tips By Ride Duration",
    x = "Ride Duration (minutes)",
    y = "Tip"
  )

ggTipsRideDuration
```

We can see that there isn't much of a predictable influence of ride duration on tipping behavior, with maybe the exception of night life rides. This is an interesting finding, because it represents a very distinct use cases (commuter vs. leisure time rides).

```{r median-trip-distance}
ggTripDistance <- rides.chicago %>%
  group_by(ride_category, dow) %>%
  summarize(median_trip_dist = median(Trip.Miles)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    y = median_trip_dist,
    x = ride_category
  )) +
  geom_point(aes(color = ride_category),
    size = 4,
    show.legend = TRUE
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1),
    linetype = "dotted"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~dow, nrow = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(
    title = "Ride Category",
    labels = c(
      "morning commute",
      "late morning",
      "afternoon",
      "evening commute",
      "night life"
    )
  )) +
  # this is for the legend on the graph
  ylab("Median Trip (Miles)") +
  xlab("Day of Week") +
  ggtitle("Median Trip Distance")
ggTripDistance
```

Longer ride durations will generate more revenue for both drivers and the rideshare service. This maybe a 
useful signal of LTV if these passengers have a regular use case for taking these longer rides.

## Next steps

**What have we observed?** 

Rideshare trips tend to be clustered around early morning commute hours and nightlife hours. The surge in night life hours is particularly pronounced on Fridays and Saturdays, with a sharp decline Sunday evening. This makes sense because most people are preparing for their next work week on Sunday evening, not going out or catching a movie. 

In addition we can see that there are behavioral gaps to influence our passenger’s engagement with both the product and their drivers. One of those behaviors it tipping.

Tipping is infrequent overall, but the time of day appears to influence a passenger’s willingness to tip more than the duration of the ride. Longer rides tend to occur early in the week, which suggests a possible passenger scenario where an initial trip is required for the week (such as consultants who only travel early in the week to get to their clients). 

These visulizations have helped us uncover some trends and relationships between time, frequency and behavior in the Chicago ride share data--next time we will take a deeper look into some prediction and modeling. 

At this stage we can already see that the end goal for these data is going to be something beyond a static report, powerpoint presentation, or PDF. Ideally, we would be able to come up with an intervention, design and experiment, and build a dashboard that would allow real-time data and ongoing results of our investigation.
