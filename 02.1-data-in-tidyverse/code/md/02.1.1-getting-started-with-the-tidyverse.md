# Motivation

*TLDR: This tutorial was prompted by the recent changes to the `tidyr`
package (see the tweet from Hadley Wickham below). Two functions for
reshaping data (`gather()` and `spread()`) were replaced with `pivot_`
functions. I include the tweet below to give an example of how these
packages evolve (and how their authors incorporate users input into
their decisions)*

## Objectives

This tutorial will introduce three underlying concepts about working
with data in the `tidyverse`: 1) tidy data, 2) pivoting, and 3)
grouping. A solid understanding of these concepts will make it easier to
use the other packages in the `tidyverse` to manipulate and re-structure
your data for visualizations and modeling. We will also show how column
and row arrangements that make data entry and collection easier are
rarely ideal for data visualization or analysis.

## Loading the packages

Install and load the following packages for this tutorial.

``` r
# this will require the newest version of tidyr from github
# devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

# Refresher: What is (are?) tidy data?

“Tidy data” is a term that describes a standardized approach to
structuring datasets to make analyses and visualizations easier in R. If
you’ve worked with SQL and relational databases, you’ll recognize most
of these concepts. Hadley Wickham distilled a lot of the technical
jargon from [Edgar F. Codd’s ‘normal
form’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form) and applied it
to statistical terms. More importantly, he translated these essential
principles into concepts and terms a broader audience can grasp and use
for data manipulation. The first concept we will cover is **tidy data**.

### The core tidy data principles

Tidy data, at least in the `tidyverse`, is referring to ‘rectangular’
data. These are the data we typically see in spreadsheet software like
Googlesheets, Microsoft Excel, or in a relational database like MySQL or
Microsoft Access, The three principles for tidy rectangular data are:

1.  Variables make up columns
2.  Observations (or cases) go in the rows
3.  Values are in cells

While these might seem obvious at first, many of the problematic data
arrangements you’ll encounter come from not adhering to their guidance.
Bear with me as I walk through why if the two first statements are true,
the third becomes all but guaranteed (see image below).

![](images/table-intersection.png)<!-- -->

Not all data you’ll encounter are arranged in a tidy way, but I think
transforming and thinking of your data into this format is a helpful way
to understand data manipulation in the `tidyverse`.

## It’s the same information, but different data

Typically data summaries found in textbooks don’t show the underlying
raw data file. In epidemiology and biostatistics, many statistics are
calculated using counts of binary outcomes in a 2x2 contingency tables
(`positive test`/`negative test`, `disease`/`no disease`, etc).
Presenting the data this way allows for an easier calculation of odds
ratios, relative risks, sensitivity, specificity, etc. Unfortunately,
these 2x2 tables don’t tell us anything about the structure of the
underlying data.

For example, let’s assume we’re looking at the results of an experiment
that tested a binary outcome in two groups.

**Experimental Results:**

|           | Outcome | No Outcome | Total |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Treatment | 3       | 206        |       |
| Control   | 26      | 180        |       |
| Total     |         |            | 415   |

The contingency table above displays the results grouped neatly by group
(`Treatment` and `Control`) and outcome (`No Outcome` or `Outcome`).

What would these data look like in a spreadsheet or .csv file? We can
see there must be a variable for `group` assignment and `result`s, and
these would need to be recorded by patient. So the data might have the
arrangement we see below in the `TrialData` data frame.

| patient | group   | result     |
| ------: | :------ | :--------- |
|     265 | control | no outcome |
|     344 | control | no outcome |
|     214 | control | outcome    |
|     320 | control | no outcome |
|     359 | control | no outcome |
|     277 | control | no outcome |
|     385 | control | no outcome |
|     347 | control | no outcome |
|     333 | control | no outcome |
|     260 | control | no outcome |

Note how different these two tables look–it’s hard to believe both
tables are showing the same data\! But If we wanted to get the aggregate
data display like the 2x2 table above, we could use a combination of
`dplyr` and `tidyr` functions.

``` r
knitr::kable(
  TrialData %>%
    dplyr::group_by(result, group) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(count = n()) %>%
    tidyr::spread(result, count) %>%
    dplyr::select(outcome, `no outcome`) %>%
    dplyr::arrange(outcome)
)
```

| outcome | no outcome |
| ------: | ---------: |
|       3 |        206 |
|      26 |        180 |

As you can see, both tables contain the same information, they’re just
arranged in a different way.

### How are summary tables created?

Summary tables display counts and summary statistics of raw data. These
tables also drastically change the shape of the data frame. The three
primary `tidyverse` functions that make these types of transformations
possible are `dplyr::group_by()` + `dplyr::summarize()` and
`tidyr::spread()` + `tidyr::gather()`.

The `dplyr::group_by()` and `dplyr::summarize()` functions collapse the
orginal `TrialData` into a smaller, condensed version of the original
data set. The `dplyr::group_by()` function separates the data into any
number of groups, then `dplyr::summarize()` is combined with various
aggregation functions (`sum()`, `n()`, `mean()`, etc.) to calculate
summary statistics for each of the groups being compared. The final step
is to `dplyr::ungroup()` the data table.

``` r
knitr::kable(
  TrialData %>%
    dplyr::group_by(result, group) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(count = n()) %>%
    dplyr::ungroup())
```

| result     | group     | count |
| :--------- | :-------- | ----: |
| no outcome | control   |   180 |
| no outcome | treatment |   206 |
| outcome    | control   |    26 |
| outcome    | treatment |     3 |

Notice these steps don’t create the 2x2 table (they create a 3x5 table).
And we haven’t changed much in terms of the table’s shape: `result` and
`group` are columns in both data sets, so all we’ve done is add the
`count` column (in fact, the `dplyr::count()` function does exactly
this, but I’m using the more verbose method to demonstrate whats
happening under the hood).

To create the 2x2 table we need to use `tidyr::spread()` to rotate the
row contents into the columns–or to **pivot** the `result` and `count`
columns–from a vertically aligned display to a horizontally arranged
display.

``` r
knitr::kable(
  TrialData %>%
    dplyr::group_by(result, group) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(count = n()) %>%
    dplyr::ungroup() %>%
    # spread result and count across the the columns
    tidyr::spread(key = result, 
                  value = count))
```

| group     | no outcome | outcome |
| :-------- | ---------: | ------: |
| control   |        180 |      26 |
| treatment |        206 |       3 |

The `tidyverse` has a handful of functions for creating new columns and
rows so our 2x2 table looks identical to the **Experiment Results**
table above.

``` r
knitr::kable(
  TrialData %>%
    dplyr::group_by(result, group) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(count = n()) %>%
    dplyr::ungroup() %>%
    # spread result and count across the the columns
    tidyr::spread(key = result, 
                  value = count) %>%
    # get rowwise totals
    dplyr::rowwise() %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(TOTAL = sum(`no outcome` + outcome)) %>% 
    # ungroup
    dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
    # summarize all and bind to bottom of data set
    bind_rows(summarise_all(.,
               list(~if (is.numeric(.)) sum(.)
                    else "TOTAL"))))
```

| group     | no outcome | outcome | TOTAL |
| :-------- | ---------: | ------: | ----: |
| control   |        180 |      26 |   206 |
| treatment |        206 |       3 |   209 |
| TOTAL     |        386 |      29 |   415 |

## Pivoting

This brings us to *pivoting*, the [recent
additions](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html) to the
`tidyr` package. These functions will be slowly replacing the previous
functions for reshaping data frames, `tidyr::gather()` and
`tidyr::spread()`. I found it refreshing to learn that I wasn’t the only
person struggling to use these functions. Hadley Wickham, the package
developer/author, confessed he also struggles when using these
functions,

> Many people don’t find the names intuitive and find it hard to
> remember which direction corresponds to spreading and which to
> gathering. It also seems surprisingly hard to remember the arguments
> to these functions, meaning that many people (including me\!) have to
> consult the documentation every time.

Statements like these are examples of why I appreciate the `tidyverse`,
because I can tell a lot of thought gets put into identifying verbs that
accurately capture the users intentions. Knowing how to reshape data is
an important skill for data scientists, and I think the `tidyr::pivot_`
functions are great additions to data manipulation in the `tidyverse`.

### It’s like having fancy footwork

Vasily Lomachenko, the best [pound-for-pound
boxer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_pound_for_pound_rankings) in
the world, is known for taking [traditional Ukrainian dance classes as a
child before ever stepping into a boxing
ring](traditional%20Ukrainian%20dance%20classes). Why would an athlete
who punches people for a living spend time learning how to dance?
Because having precise footwork and the ability to change direction
sharply is so essential in boxing that these skills are often what
separates a good fighter from an elite
athlete.

![<http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-pivots-and-precision-of-vasyl-lomachenko>](images/loma-pivot.gif)

As you can see, Lomachenko’s pivoting abilities not only make him
frustratingly hard to hit, but they also allow him to see openings in
his opponents defense (which makes him incredibly successful at landing
punches).

![<http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-pivots-and-precision-of-vasyl-lomachenko>](images/loma-pivot-strike.gif)

*Why am I telling you about Vasyl Lomachenko’s footwork?*

The `tidyr::pivot_` functions give you a similar ability with your data.
Being able to rapidly rotate your data from columns to rows (and back)
is similar to being able to turn 90 degrees on a dime and avoid an
incoming punch (or to see an opening and land a stiff jab).

> “I think footwork is one of the most important things to becoming a
> great fighter. That’s where everything starts.” - Vasyl Lomachenko

We’re going to start by manipulating a data set of Lomachenko’s fights
from the [BoxRec](http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/659771) database. The fight
information has been entered in a way that makes sense for the person
entering the data, but it’s not ideal for analysis or modeling.

## Lomachenko fight data

We will load Lomachenko’s fight record from Wikipedia and explore how to
use these new functions. To see how these data are created, check out
the script file
[here](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/storybenchR/blob/master/02.1-tidyr-tidyverse/loma-fights-wikipedia.R)

``` r
# fs::dir_ls("data")
LomaFightsWide <- readr::read_csv(file = "data/2019-03-29-LomaFightsWide.csv")
```

![](images/loma-wide.png)<!-- -->

## Are these data tidy?

These data are not tidy because the dates for each fight are in a
separate columns. Formatting the data this way might seem odd to a data
scientist, but this configuration makes sense for a fan entering the
fights into a spreadsheet as they happen in real time. Consider the the
chronological chain of events involved with a each fight,

1.  An opponent and location is announced, and an excited fan enters the
    information into the first two column/rows in a spreadsheet and
    titles it, ’Lomachenko\`
2.  In order to track an athlete’s win/loss record over the course of
    their career, a number is also marked for each fight (starting with
    `1`) in a column titled, `fight_number`
3.  The date for the first fight gets entered into the `D` column (the
    fourth in the table), and the result gets put in the corresponding
    cell
4.  After the scorecards are collected, the technical `result` is
    announced (see key below), the `fight_record` is updated (with the
    official outcome of the bout)
5.  The official round and time (`round_time`) is recorded for when the
    fight had to stop (or the total number of rounds if it went the
    distance),
6.  Titles and belts are listed in the `notes` section
7.  When the next fight happens, our fan right-clicks on the last
    recorded fight, and inserts a new column
8.  Steps 1-6 get repeated, and this table grows

As you can see, all of these steps are sensible for someone wanting to
track their favorite athlete (or sports team) over time. I think of this
data arrangement as *data-entry friendly*, because the table captures
enough information to be useful, and it has a few computational
abilities. For example, a fan could use filtering to count the number of
`TKO`s a fighter has, or sort the `fight_record` column to figure what
Lomachenko’s record. Spreadsheets like these are a cross between a
timeline and a record book, and they do a good enough job at both tasks
to justify their current structure.

The [pivot
vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html#wide-to-long)
conveys that ‘wide’ formats or data arrangements are common because
their primary purpose and design is centered around recording data (and
not visualization or modeling),

> …wild-caught datasets as they often optimize for ease of data entry or
> ease of comparison rather than ease of analysis.

The `LomaFightsWide` data is one of these *wild-caught* data sets.

## Pivoting from wide (to longer)

Before diving into the `pivot_longer` function and it’s arguments, I
want to imagine how the data I have will look in a tidy format. The
figure below demonstrates how I’m envisioning the `LomaFightsWide` in a
tidy arrangement.

![](images/tidy-pivoting-longer.png)<!-- -->

Using the figure as a guide, I can see the first thing I’m going to do
is reorganize the columns to make these data easier to see in the
RMarkdown file. I’ll start with the `opponent` variable, list out each
date column with the fight results, and then all of the remaining
variables.

``` r
LomaFightsWide <- LomaFightsWide %>%
  dplyr::select(
    opponent,
    `12 Oct 2013`:`12 Apr 2019`,
    dplyr::everything())
```

*Why start with the `opponent` variable?* Because the two pieces of
information I am most interested in is 1) who Lomachenko fought, and 2)
the outcome of the fight. That means I need each of these in their own
variable. Right now I only have the `opponent`, so I need to create a
`result` column.

``` r
LomaFightsWide %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

![](images/loma-wide-reorganize.png)<!-- -->

If I’m sticking with the boxing analogy, the `opponent` column
represents the leg I plant firmly on the ground, and the individual date
columns are the opposite leg that rotates 90 degrees to change the
angle. Although I’m using `tidyr::pivot_longer()`, these changes may not
always result in a ‘longer’ data frame.

> “Note that I don’t believe it makes sense to describe a dataset as
> being in “long form”. Length is a relative term, and you can only say
> (e.g.) that dataset A is longer than dataset B."
> [source](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html#wide-to-long)

``` r
LomaFightsLonger <- LomaFightsWide %>%
  # specify columns to pivot into rows
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = `12 Oct 2013`:`12 Apr 2019`,
    # the name of the new variable (used to be the columns)
    names_to = "date",
    # name of the variable for what was in these columns
    values_to = "win_loss",
    # what to do about the missing values?
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

![](images/loma-pivot-glimpse.png)<!-- -->

I can see from the newly created data frame (`LomaFightsLonger`) that
the `date` column is still formatted as a character, but I’d prefer it
formatted as a `<date>`. This presents an excellent opportunity to use
the new `tidyr::pivot_longer_spec()` function, because it allows me to
store some additional metadata about data transformations.

## Pivoting plus bookkeeping

We’ll continue with the original Lomachenko data (`LomaFightsWide`) to
demonstrate how to use the `tidyr::pivot_longer_spec` function and
`spec` argument.

### *What is a `spec`?*

> *A pivoting spec is a data frame that describes the metadata stored in
> the column name, with one row for each column, and one column for each
> variable mashed into the column name.*

Explicitly creating an object that contains data about your data is not
necessarily a novel concept in R, but it’s very handy when that object
is similar to the other objects you’re already working with (i.e. a data
frame or tibble).

Creating a `spec` for the `LomaFightsWide` data frame is a three-step
process:

#### 1\) Store the functions for reshaping the date columns `12 Oct 2013` through `12 Apr 2019` into an object I will name `loma_spec`, which is a data frame with three variables in it: `.name`, `.value`, and `date`

``` r
loma_spec <- LomaFightsWide %>%
  # specify columns to pivot into rows
  tidyr::pivot_longer_spec(
    cols = `12 Oct 2013`:`12 Apr 2019`,
    # the name of the new variable (used to be the columns)?
    names_to = "date",
    # name of the variable for what was in these columns?
    values_to = "win_loss"
  )
loma_spec %>% utils::str()
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    14 obs. of  3 variables:
    ##  $ .name : chr  "12 Oct 2013" "1 Mar 2014" "21 Jun 2014" "22 Nov 2014" ...
    ##  $ .value: chr  "win_loss" "win_loss" "win_loss" "win_loss" ...
    ##  $ date  : chr  "12 Oct 2013" "1 Mar 2014" "21 Jun 2014" "22 Nov 2014" ...

The three columns in `loma_spec` contain metadata (data about the data)
on the transformation I’ll be performing–specifically the originally
columns (`.name`) and the corresponding cell values (`.value`). The
other variable (`date`) gets carried over from the transformation as
well.

#### 2\) Use `dplyr::mutate()` to format the `date` variable with `lubridate::dmy()`

If I want to format the `date` variable, I can include those arguments
*within* the `loma_spec` data frame.

``` r
# format the date
loma_spec <- loma_spec %>%
  dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::dmy(date))
loma_spec$date %>% glimpse(78)
```

    ##  Date[1:14], format: "2013-10-12" "2014-03-01" "2014-06-21" "2014-11-22" "2015-05-02" ...

#### 3\) Finally, I supply the `loma_spec` object to the `spec` argument in the `tidyr::pivot_longer_spec()` function.

Now the `loma_spec` can get supplied to the `pivot_longer()` function
and the `date` variable is properly formatted (note I still need to
provide the `na.rm = TRUE` argument).

``` r
# supply it to the pivot_longer
LomaFightsLonger <- LomaFightsWide %>%
  pivot_longer(
    spec = loma_spec,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

``` r
LomaFightsLonger %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

![](images/loma-spec-date.png)<!-- -->

## Values and variables across columns

In the example above, there was only one value per opponent, but it
isn’t hard to image a situation where this wasn’t the case. Suppose
the trial we introduced above also collected data on the physician, and
a variable documenting if the treatment was administered, and a
corresponding `date` variable.

``` r
TrialDataWide <- tibble::tribble(
       ~physician_id, ~treatment1,   ~trt_date1, ~treatment2,   ~trt_date2,
           99999091L,          1L, "2017-11-26",         "1", "2018-01-29",
           99999072L,          1L, "2018-06-01",          NA,           NA,
           99999033L,          1L, "2018-09-11",         "1", "2018-12-05",
           99999024L,          1L, "2017-10-10",          NA,           NA,
           99999040L,          1L, "2017-02-05",         "1", "2018-04-12")
TrialDataWide
```

## Multiple variables in a single column (throwback)

You’ve probably noticed there are two variables in the `round_time`
column. The first is the round the fight ended in (presented as `final
round (total rounds)`) and the `time` in that round (`minutes:seconds`).
In order to break these two variables into their own columns, I can use
the `tidyr::separate()` function to split these two variables apart into
their own columns.

``` r
LomaFightsLonger %>%
  tidyr::separate(
    col = round_time,
    into = c("fight_rounds", "fight_time"),
    sep = ",",
    remove = FALSE
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(round_time:fight_time)
```

<div class="kable-table">

| round\_time   | fight\_rounds | fight\_time |

</div>

This throws the following warning,

`Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with`NA`in 5 rows
[2, 3, 4, 13, 14].`

but as we can see from the table above, there is no real reason for
concern. The `fight_rounds` and `fight_time` are each in their own
column.

### Variables *and* values in column names

Sometimes it’s not only that two different values end up in the same
column, but the actual variable names are separate columns as well. This
can happen when the goal of the spreadsheet is to compare or track two
columns *visually*.

Think back to the avid sports fan we introduced above, Now we will
assume he’s interested in tracking the epic saga between Gennady
Gennadyevich Golovkin (triple G or GGG) and Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez that
went from September 16th, 2017 until their rematch a year later on
September 15th, 2018. Each of these fighters were considered to be at
(or near) the top of their game, so many titles were on line in each
fight.

In order to track exactly what titles each fighter had before/after the
fight, the following spreadsheet gets created:

``` r
CaneloGGGTitles <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  title = c(
    "WBA (Super champion)",
    "IBF world champion",
    "WBC world champion",
    "IBO world champion",
    "The Ring world champions"
  ),
  ggg_title_date = c(
    "2014-06-03",
    "2015-10-17",
    "2016-05-18",
    "2011-12-09",
    NA
  ),
  canelo_title_date = c("2018-09-15", NA, "2018-09-15", NA, "2015-11-21"),
  ggg_title_opp = c(
    "Milton Núñez, (4 Aug 2010)",
    "David Lemieux, (17 Oct 2015)",
    "Marco Antonio Rubio, (18 Oct 2014)",
    "Lajuan Simon",
    NA
  ),
  ggg_notes = c(
    "Regular champ promoted",
    "Golovkin was stripped of this title when he failed to agree in writing to a fight with Derevyanchenko",
    "Elevated from interim status",
    "Won vacant IBO middleweight title",
    NA
  ),
  canelo_title_opp = c(
    "Gennady Golovkin",
    NA,
    "Gennady Golovkin",
    NA,
    "Miguel Cotto, (Nov 21, 2015)"
  ),
  canelo_notes = c(
    "Alvarez beats GGG, gains Super champion title",
    NA,
    "Alvarez beats GGG, gains WBC middleweight champion title",
    NA,
    "June 2018 (stripped of title), wins vacant The Ring middleweight title on Sep 15, 2018 against Gennady Golovkin"
  )
)
CaneloGGGTitles
```

As we can see, Canelo went into the fight with more title’s to win (the
`WBA`, `IBF` and `WBC` and `IBO` middleweight titles), and only one
title to lose (`The Ring world champion` title).

*Why would the data look this way?*

Sometimes it’s hard to capture data in a tidy format because the thing
being measured is genuinely complicated. Remember that data are an
abstraction of something we want to quantify (or count). Boxing
championships (and many other things in life), are often thought of in
terms of a narrative.

RTD = A corner retirement or corner stoppage..during any rest period
between rounds, a boxer refuses to continue or their corner pulls them
out, thereby forcing the referee to call an end to the fight.

UD = all three judges agree on which fighter won the match.

MD = In a majority decision, two of the three judges agree on which
fighter won the match, while the third judge indicates that neither
fighter won (i.e., a “draw”).

These new functions borrow ideas from the
[`cdata`](https://winvector.github.io/cdata/) and
[`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki)
packages.
