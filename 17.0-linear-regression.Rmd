# Linear models 

Linear regression is one of the most common models used in statistics. They're an excellent point of entry into statistical inference because they're relatively easy to graph and visualize. Linear relationships are pretty intuitive, too. You've probably thought of two measurements as a having a linear relationship and didn't realize it. In this post, we will cover the essential elements of linear regression models and how to use them to make predictions.

## What is a model?

In statistics and data science, the term 'model' is used to describe our best attempt to represent some phenomena with numbers and math. In the same way that LEGO models provide children a smaller version of reality to play with, statistical models give us the ability to think about relationships between things in the real world. 

These models give us the ability to make predictions about how the world works, which is always valuable. For example, Amazon uses machine learning algorithms to provide you an estimate of when your order arrives on your doorstep. Netflix and YouTube use data and statistics to determine and recommend what movies and shows you'll enjoy.

It's crucial always to remember that counting and measurement are tricky, so the models built on those numbers should be interpreted and applied with caution. We need to remember statistical models are toy versions of reality. That fact becomes evident when--despite the massive amounts of data we have--a model fails to make an accurate prediction (and your Prime order shows up two days late).  

If you are wondering why there is so much dependence on statistical modeling when it's clear they can still lead us astray? Well, think back to the LEGOs: children learn a lot about reality by building LEGO models. In particular, they learn to experiment, and how to implement trial and error, two major components of science. The quote below summarizes these aspects quite well,

> "Science is the driving component behind all creations that a child has. The foundation of science is to come up with an idea and to prove it practically. LEGOs do this naturally through imagination. A child simply comes up with an idea then develops it." - [Preschool inspirations](https://preschoolinspirations.com/10-important-skills-children-learn-legos/)

Statistical models are a direct analog of the lessons above. Someone comes up with an idea, develops the concept into something they can measure, then they use a model to see how well their idea holds up. More importantly, statistical models don't have to *prove* anything to help us understand the world around us. Consider the wise words from George Box, 

> "Models, of course, are never true, but fortunately, it is only necessary that they be useful." - George Box, [Some Problems of Statistics and Everyday Life](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1979.10481600)

Knowing which models *aren't* a good representation of reality is as essential for advancing science as discovering the useful models. As Karl Popper, the philosopher of science emphasized, there are only a few ways to get the right model and an infinite number of ways to get it wrong. Identifying the incorrect model clarifies our thinking and helps us move forward towards a better understanding. Building and comparing the results from multiple models allow the best to rise to the top, and those models that remain after many experiments often turn out to be quite reliable.

## Visualizing relationships

We will start by visualizing a relationship between two variables. Before looking at actual data, we should start by getting an idea of what we should expect to see. For example, let's consider a headline from the data journalism site Fivethirtyeight published in 2017 titled, ["Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality."](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/). 

That headline might give the impression that the article contains anecdotal information about two fuzzy concepts. But the language is giving us hints about what the graph of these two measurements might look like. For instance, "*Higher Rates Of...*" and "*Are Tied To...*" sounds like "*When this number is high*" and  "*so is this number*" So if we drew a graph of these two measurements with an `x` and `y` coordinate, it might look like the figure below. 

```{r 01-linear-regression-sketch, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/17.1-linear-regression-sketch-01.png")
```

By convention, we typical call the measurement we're trying to predict the **outcome** or **response** variable, and put it on the `y` axis. The variables we'll use for explanation or prediction are typically called (you guessed it) **explanatory** or **predictor** variables, and we place these numbers on the `x` axis. We agree with [Julian J. Faraway](https://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/) and avoid using the terms *independent* or *dependent* unless we've designed and experiment, but we will discuss this topic more in a later post.

These could also be linear, but in the other direction: 

```{r 01-linear-regression-sketch-2, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/17.1-linear-regression-sketch-02.png")
```

Generally, the important part about linear relationships is what the line represents. But in order to explore this more, we will need some actual data! 

## Download and import data 

The code chunk below downloads and imports the data for this post:

```{r import-comedy-data-github, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
source("code/17.1-import.R")
# ls()
```

Let's graph the `outcome` on the `x`, and the `predictor_1` on the `y`, and draw a line that passes through the mean of the outcome variable. We can use `skimr` to summarize the `SimData` dataset. 

```{r skim_numeric}
skim(SimDat)
```

We can see the means for the `outcome` and both `predictor_` variables. Below we're going to plot the means of `outcome` and `predictor_1` on a graph using `ggplot2`. First we'll create a custom `theme` with `ggplot2::theme_set()` and `hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_tw()`.

```{r set-theme}
# set the theme to theme_light
ggplot2::theme_set(theme_ipsum_tw(base_family = "Titillium Web",
                         base_size = 12, 
                         plot_title_family = "Poppins",
                         axis_title_size = 15))
```

Now we can plot the means. 

```{r 01-plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1}
# define labs first
sim_labs <- ggplot2::labs(
    title = "Simulated outcome and predictor",
    x = "Predictor variable",
    y = "Outcome variable",
    caption = "outcome mean = 2.02, predictor_1 mean = 2.82"
)
# get the summary stats for predictor_1
mean_p1 <- mean(SimDat$predictor_1)
# get the mean for outcome
mean_outcome <- mean(SimDat$outcome)
# plot data 
plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1 <- SimDat %>% 
    # plot the predictor on x
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = predictor_1, 
                        # plot the outcome on y
                        y = outcome)) + 
    # add the mean, min, and max for the outcome variable
    ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = mean_outcome, 
                color = "orange") + 
    # add the mean for the predictor_1 variable 
    ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = mean_p1,
                color = "green") +
    # add labels
    sim_labs
plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1
```

The lines on the graph above cross each axis at the means for each `predictor_1` and `outcome` variable. So, if the mean represents the 'middle' of the data points for each measure, we can begin to imagine where the data points will be when they are added to the graph. Lets add the actual data points now (before the lines).

```{r 02-plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1v2}
plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1v2 <- plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1 +
    # add the points
    ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = 1/6)

plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1v2
```

The intersection for these lines looks like it's right in the middle of all the points, right? Next we'll see how well we can predict the `outcome` with a given value of the `predictor_1`.  

I like building plots like this with `ggplot2` because I can understand how the variables relate to each other iteratively (to learn more about ggplot2 check out our tutorial [here](http://www.storybench.org/getting-started-data-visualization-r-using-ggplot2/)).

## Linear models 

A linear model tells us how the mean of the `outcome` variable varies with the `predictor_1` variable. Fortunately for us, `ggplot2` comes with a `geom` that we can use to fit a linear model through our data points. The `ggplot2::geom_smooth()` function has a `method` argument, and we can tell it to use `"lm"`, for linear model.

```{r 03-plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1v2}
plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1v3 <- plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1v2 +
    # add the points
    ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm")
plot_MeanOutcomePredictor1v3
```

The blue line is the best fit linear (straight line) that goes through the mean of both the `predictor_1` and the `outcome`. The number of points above and below this line indicate how well the predictor variable predicts or explains the `outcome`.

But not all relationships are linear, and it's important to know what a non-linear relationship looks like, because assuming two variables have a linear relationship without visualizing them can get us in trouble. If we swap out `predictor_1` for `predictor_2` we see an example of a non-linear relationship.

<!--
```{r 01-non-linear-regression-sketch, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/17.1-non-linear-regression-sketch.png")
```
-->

```{r 05-plot_MeanOutcomePredictor2}
# define labs first 
sim_labs2 <- ggplot2::labs(
    title = "Simulated outcome and predictor",
    x = "Predictor variable",
    y = "Outcome variable",
    caption = "outcome mean = 2.02, predictor_2 mean = 8.16"
)
# get the summary stats for predictor_1
mean_p2 <- mean(SimDat$predictor_2)
# plot data 
plot_MeanOutcomePredictor2 <- SimDat %>% 
    # plot the predictor on x
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = predictor_2, 
                        # plot the outcome on y
                        y = outcome)) + 
    # add the mean, min, and max for the outcome variable
    ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = mean_outcome, 
                color = "orange") + 
    # add the mean for the predictor_1 variable 
    ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = mean_p2,
                color = "green") +
    # add the points
    ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = 1/6) + 
    # add the points
    ggplot2::geom_smooth() +
    # add labels
    sim_labs2
plot_MeanOutcomePredictor2
```

As we can see, the swarm of points for these two variables looks very different than the previous graph. Linear relationships are useful for prediction and explanation, but only if the underlying data meet the assumptions for the model. Let's explore linear models more with some real life data. 

## YouTube comedy sketch data 

Key and Peele are...

Amy Schumer is...

Now that we have an idea for what a linear relationship between these two variable might look like, we can start graphing the data and see if it meets our expectations. The data If we read the [README](https://github.com/richardcornish/sketch-comedy-data), we discover both datasets have the following variables:

<!--
```json
   "statistics": {
    "viewCount": "3057",
    "likeCount": "25",
    "dislikeCount": "0",
    "favoriteCount": "17",
    "commentCount": "12"
}
```
-->

- `published_at` = date video was published 
- `dislike_count` = number of dislikes 
- `url` = url for video  
- `id` = id for video 
- `comment_count` = number of comments per video 
- `title` = title of video 
- `view_count` = number of views per video 
- `like_count` = number of likes per video 

We can check for the objects using `ls()` to make sure they imported.

```{r check-import}
ls()
```


### Wrangling steps

These data don't need much wrangling, but I like to break out wrangling into two separate tasks: things I do that change or create entire data set(s), and 2) things I do that change or create new variables. I typically have a few variables in mind when I start building visualizations or models, but this always takes a few steps to get the variables or data exactly how I want them.

If I frame it this way, it forces me to think about the global changes that need to happen for me to create the variables I need. Below are two scripts I use for the two wrangling steps I described above: 1) remove the Private videos (there are no metrics for these) from both data sets, 2) then create a new variable that helps me identify the `comedian`. The final step and format the variable names.  

```{r tidy-import-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
source("code/17.2-tidy.R")
source("code/17.3-wrangle.R")
```

```{r AmySchumer}
skim(AmySchumer)
```

```{r KeyAndPeele}
skim(KeyAndPeele)
```

I also bind the datasets together and add the following variable to keep track of who's data we're looking at:

- `comedian` = comedian name 

```{r YouTubeComedyData}
skim(YouTubeComedyData)
```

## Visualizing YouTube views vs. likes 

I love comedy, and YouTube has tons of short clips from my favorite comedians. I'm curious about the relationship between the number of times a video is viewed, and how that relates to the number of times a video receives a 'like' (or thumbs up). Why would I assume this relationship is linear? Good question. I think this might be a linear relationship because everyone can only like a YouTube video once, and my personal assumption is most people who view comedy skits are in a happy mood, so they'll be more likely to 'like' the videos that made them laugh. 

So we've loaded data from two comedy acts (technically three people, so I'll be referring to each data set as representing an 'act') from YouTube. All of the sketch acts stored in `YouTubeComedyData` data set, and we also have a data set for each act: `AmySchumer` and `KeyAndPeele`. 

We will start by looking to see if the `YouTubeComedyData` data can help us figure out if there is a linear relationship between views and likes. 

```{r 01-plot_Views_Likes}
plot_Views_Likes <- YouTubeComedyData %>% 
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(
     # views 
    x = view_count,
     # likes
    y = like_count
  )) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(
    size = 2,
    alpha = 6 / 10,
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
      # add titles
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Views of Amy Schumer and Key & Peele comedy sketches on YouTube",
    y = "Likes of Amy Schumer and Key & Peele comedy sketches on YouTube"
  )
plot_Views_Likes
```

The relationship looks linear, but this graph isn't showing us both sets of comedian data very well. We'll plot each artist independently to clear up some of the over-plotting. 

```{r 02-plot_AmySchumerViewVsLikes}
# start with labels
amys_labs <- ggplot2::labs(
        title = "Views VS Likes of Amy Schumer's YouTube Videos",
            x = "Views of Amy Schumer comedy sketches",
            y = "Likes of Amy Schumer comedy sketches") 

plot_AmySchumerViewVsLikes <- AmySchumer %>%  
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(
     # views 
    x = view_count,
     # likes
    y = like_count
  )) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(
    size = 2,
    alpha = 6 / 10,
    color = "darkred",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  # add titles
    hrbrthemes::scale_fill_ipsum() + 
    hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc(base_family = "EnvyCodeR", 
                               base_size = 12,
                               axis_title_size = 15,
                               plot_title_size = 18,
                               plot_title_family = "Menlo-Regular") +
    ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = c(0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1))) +
    ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "Bottom") + 
    amys_labs
plot_AmySchumerViewVsLikes
```

```{r 03-plot_KeyAndPeeleViewVsLikes}
# start with labs
kandp_labs <- ggplot2::labs(
  title = "Views VS Likes of Key & Peele's YouTube Videos",
    x = "Views of Key and Peele comedy sketches on YouTube",
    y = "Likes of Key and Peele comedy sketches on YouTube")
# plot 2
plot_KeyAndPeeleViewVsLikes <- KeyAndPeele %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(
      # views 
    x = view_count,
      # likes
    y = like_count
  )) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(
    size = 2,
    alpha = 6 / 10,
    color = "royalblue",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  hrbrthemes::scale_color_ipsum() +
  hrbrthemes::scale_fill_ipsum() +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_tw(base_size = 12,
                             axis_title_size = 14, 
                             plot_title_size = 22) +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # add labs
  kandp_labs
plot_KeyAndPeeleViewVsLikes
```

```{r maxes, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
amy_max_view_count <- max(AmySchumer[ , "view_count"], na.rm = TRUE)
kp_max_view_count <- max(KeyAndPeele[ , "view_count"], na.rm = TRUE)
```

This is better because we can see a separate plot for each comedic act, but we still have the issue of outliers. The relationship between views and likes certainly looks linear for both sets of videos, but the maximum values for `view_count` is making it hard to read. The max `view_count` for `Amy Schumer` is `r amy_max_view_count`, and the max `view_count` for `Key & Peele` is `r kp_max_view_count`. Including these max values creates a ton of empty chart space. 

Let's take a look at the highest views for each video by comedic act, and label those on the graph. 


```{r 03-plot_AmySchumerViewVsLikesV2}
# first we create some data sets for the top views and likes 
TopAmyViews <- AmySchumer %>% dplyr::filter(view_count >= 3000000 | 
                                                like_count >= 30000)
plot_AmySchumerViewVsLikesV2 <- AmySchumer %>%  
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(
     # views 
    x = view_count,
     # likes
    y = like_count
  )) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(
    size = 2,
    alpha = 6 / 10,
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) + 
  # add labels to states
  geom_text_repel(
    data = TopAmyViews, 
    aes(label = title),
    # size of text
    size = 3.5,
    # opacity of the text
    alpha = 7 / 10,
    # in case there is overplotting
    arrow = arrow(
      length = unit(0.05, "inches"),
      type = "open",
      ends = "last"
    ),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
    # add some color for the points
  geom_point(
    data = TopAmyViews, 
    aes(color = title, 
        label = title), 
    show.legend = FALSE) + 
  # add titles

plot_AmySchumerViewVsLikesV2
```

```{r 04-plot_KeyAndPeeleViewVsLikesV2}

TopKandPViews <- KeyAndPeele %>% dplyr::filter(view_count >= 30000000 | 
                                                   like_count >= 200000)
plot_KeyAndPeeleViewVsLikesV2 <- KeyAndPeele %>%

  )) +

    show.legend = FALSE
  ) + 
  # add labels to states

    data = TopKandPViews, 
    aes(label = title),
    # size of text
    size = 3.5,
    # opacity of the text
    alpha = 7 / 10,
    # in case there is overplotting
    arrow = arrow(
      length = unit(0.05, "inches"),
      type = "open",
      ends = "last"
    ),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +

Let's remove these outliers for now, but we'll revisit the outliers later.  
+ For `Amy Schumer`, we will focus on the YouTube data with a `view_count` of less than `3,000,000` and a `like_count` of less than `30,000`.  
+ For the `Key & Peele`, we will be looking at YouTube data with less than `30,000,000` views `200,000`.

    y = like_count)) + 
    # points
    ggplot2::geom_point(

        alpha = 6/10) +

Great! Now we can start understanding the linear relationship between these variables. 

## Checking for correlations with `corrr`

The [`corrr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrr/index.html) gives us the ability to examine the correlation between to variables we assume are related to one another. These are part of the [`tidymodels` package](https://github.com/tidymodels/corrr), a meta package for modeling in the `tidyverse`.

We will use `dplyr::select()` to get the two variables we're interested in, `view_count` and `like_count`, then pass these to the `corrr::correlate()` function. A Pearson correlation is the best option here because 

### Interpreting correlations

```{r AmySchumerSmallCor}
AmySchumerSmallCor <- AmySchumerSmall %>% 
  dplyr::select(view_count, like_count, dislike_count, comment_count) %>% 
  corrr::correlate() 
AmySchumerSmallCor
```

### Visualizing correlations

```{r network-plot}
AmySchumerSmallCor %>%    # Create correlation data frame (cor_df)
  corrr::network_plot(curved = FALSE)  # rearrange by correlations
```
