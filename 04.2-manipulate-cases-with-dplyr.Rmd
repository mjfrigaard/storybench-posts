This tutorial is part 2 of manipulating data with `dplyr` and friends in the `tidyverse`. 

For newcomers to R, check out the [Data Journalism in R](http://bit.ly/2MGFh2f) on Storybench.

# Motivation

Often you'll be interested in data that meet specific criteria, and not an entire data set. `dplyr` comes with a set of functions (verbs) for reducing a data set to only those cases that meet conditions you define. I will demonstrate these functions with the data set from last tutorial.These data are from a survey created by FiveThirtyEight for the article titled, 

["What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?".](https://53eig.ht/2FYCOQk)

Find these data in their raw form on the [GitHub repository](http://bit.ly/2RUUanr). We will load data from the last tutorial in the code chunk below:

## Importing data

```{r MascSurveyData-import}
MascSurveyData <- readr::read_csv("data/2019-08-03-MascSurveyData.csv")
```

Important things to note about the import:

1. the default column is `col_character()`, so most variables will be character strings 
2. `id` and `weight` are numeric (`col_double()`) 
3. both dates are formatted as date-time (`col_datetime(format = "")`)
4. the masculine indicator (`masc_ind`) is a binary (`TRUE` / `FALSE`) variable 

## Extract rows by position with (slice)

The `dplyr::slice()` function uses numerical indices to retrive observations from a data frame or tibble. This is similar to `head()`.

This will give me the 5th through the last observation in the `MascSurveyData` data frame

```{r slice}
MascSurveyData %>% dplyr::slice( 5:n())
```


## Filtering responses 

The `dplyr::filter()` function works by including only rows that meet a condition in a logical statement (i.e. the condition is TRUE for that case). For example, if I wanted to only include respondents who describe their sexual orientation as `"Straight"` (question 26), I would use the following:

```{r filter-1, eval=FALSE}
MascSurveyData %>% 
    dplyr::filter(q0026 == "Straight")
```

```{r filter-1-out, eval=FALSE}
# # A tibble: 1,408 x 100
#       id start_date          end_date            how_masc how_important
#    <dbl> <dttm>              <dttm>              <chr>    <chr>        
#  1     2 2018-05-10 06:30:00 2018-05-10 06:53:00 Somewha… Somewhat imp…
#  2     3 2018-05-10 07:02:00 2018-05-10 07:09:00 Very ma… Not too impo…
#  3     5 2018-05-10 07:35:00 2018-05-10 07:42:00 Very ma… Very importa…
#  4     6 2018-05-10 08:25:00 2018-05-10 08:34:00 Very ma… Somewhat imp…
#  5     8 2018-05-10 10:04:00 2018-05-10 10:11:00 Somewha… Somewhat imp…
#  6     9 2018-05-10 11:00:00 2018-05-10 11:07:00 Very ma… Not at all i…
#  7    10 2018-05-11 12:36:00 2018-05-11 12:43:00 Somewha… Somewhat imp…
#  8    11 2018-05-11 03:07:00 2018-05-11 03:16:00 Very ma… Somewhat imp…
#  9    12 2018-05-11 05:18:00 2018-05-11 05:33:00 Somewha… Not too impo…
# 10    13 2018-05-11 05:50:00 2018-05-11 05:53:00 Very ma… Somewhat imp…
# # … with 1,398 more rows, and 95 more variables:
```

This returns a data frame with fewer rows than the original (1,408 vs. 1,615) because this only includes the `"Straight"` respondents.

**Quick Tip #1:** Checking the dimensions of your data from time to time serves as a nice little sanity check :) 

## Filtering responses on multiple conditions

If I want to add another condition to `filter()` the response on, I can use the logical (`&` or `|`) operators. For example, what if I wanted to add a condition that included only respondents who were `"Divorced"` or `"Separated"` (question `q0024`)?

*I can rely on my old friend `dplyr::count()` from the last tutorial to verify I'm getting the correct counts here.*

```{r or-condition}
# add the or operator
MascSurveyData %>% 
    dplyr::filter(q0024 == "Divorced" | q0024 == "Separated") %>% 
    dplyr::count(q0024)
# this also works
MascSurveyData %>% 
    dplyr::filter(q0024 %in% c("Divorced", "Separated")) %>% 
    dplyr::count(q0024)
```

Note there are two ways to filter these data and get the same response. The `%in%` operator is better for specifying text responses (as opposed to the equal sign `=`). For example, if I wanted to build on the previous condition to include repondents who are between the ages of 18 and 34, I could add the following:

```{r and-condition}
MascSurveyData %>% 
    dplyr::filter(q0024 %in% c("Divorced", "Separated") & age3 == "18 - 34") %>% 
    dplyr::count(age3, q0024) %>% 
    tidyr::spread(q0024, n)
```

**Quick Tip #2:** Be careful with the logical operators--their order counts!

## Return unique (i.e. `distinct`) responses 

The `dplyr::distinct()` function returns the unique values in a column, data frame or tibble. It's similar to `dplyr::count()`, but it does not return the sum column. If I wanted to check the distinct responses to `q0014` (or `"How much have you heard about the #MeToo movement?"`).

```{r distinct-column}
MascSurveyData %>% dplyr::distinct(q0014)
```


Depending on the data set, I'll occaisionally also need to check if I am dealing with the distinct/unique observations (or if the rows have been duplicated). When we downloaded the `raw-responses.csv` data, we saw that there was an unnamed column (`X1`) with respondent ids (`id`). One of the ways I use `dplyr::distinct()` is in combination with `base::identical()` and `base::nrow()`.

In the `MascSurveyData`, I want the number of rows to be identical to the number of unique respondents (we know this from the documentation, but in other data arrangements it isn't as clear). I can test this by comparing the distinct number of rows in `MascSurveyData` to the number of rows in `MascSurveyData`. 

```{r check-identical}
base::identical(x = MascSurveyData %>% dplyr::distinct() %>% base::nrow(), 
                y = MascSurveyData %>% base::nrow())
```
