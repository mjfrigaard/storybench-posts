Original version: `"2017-05-12"`

Current version: `r Sys.Date()`

The [fivethirtyeight](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html) R package – released by Albert Y. Kim, Chester Ismay, and Jennifer Chunn – contains dozens of datasets used in FiveThirtyEight news articles like [The Best MLB All-Star Teams Ever](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-mlb-all-star-teams-ever/), and [The Dallas Shooting Was Among The Deadliest For Police In U.S. History.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dallas-shooting-was-among-the-deadliest-for-police-in-u-s-history/) 

This tutorial will explore a few datasets from the `fivethirtyeight` package using `tidyverse` packages and functions like `arrange`, `separate`, `separate_rows`, `gather`, and `spread` in our previous [tutorial.](http://www.storybench.org/getting-started-with-tidyverse-in-r/) It will also introduce basic visualizations with `ggplot2` geoms.

## Install and load packages

Using RStudio, install and load the `fivethirtyeight` and `tidyverse` packages (this includes `tidyr`, `tibble` and `dplyr`).

```{r packages}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading data from a package

The `mad_men` table comes from the article, ["Mad Men" Is Ending. What's Next For The Cast?"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mad-men-is-ending-whats-next-for-the-cast/). Using data from a package is like using a function from a package. The syntax is, `package::data`.

## Separating a column into multiple rows

The code below will load the `mad_men` data set into the current workspace. I prefer to assign `CamelCase` names to `data.fames` and `tibbles`, so I'll rename this to `MadMen`.  I'll also view the overall structure of this object with `dplyr::glimpse()`.

```{r data-MadMen, echo=TRUE}
MadMen <- fivethirtyeight::mad_men
MadMen %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

The article tells us this dataset has information on 248 actors who, *appeared on at least half the episodes of television shows that were nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Drama since the year 2000*.  

These data are from the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com) (IMDB) and [OpusData](https://www.opusdata.com/). There are three `_notes` variables that list the leads, supporting roles, and shows each actor has been in after their prestige television `show` ended. The `show_start` and `show_end` contain the duration of the show (in years). You can read more about the data on [FiveThirtyEight's GitHub account](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mad-men).

I'll use the `utils::head()` function to view the top six observations of the `MadMen` dataset.  

```{r head-MadMen, eval=TRUE}
MadMen %>% utils::head()
```

I can use the RStudio notebook preview window to scroll over and see that `LisaGay Hamilton` has two lead roles (`Life of a King, 2014` and `Go For Sisters, 2013`) coming up in the `lead_notes` variable. 

*These are listed next to each other, separated by a semi-colon.* 

```{r IMAGE-rstudio-head-madmen.gif, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rstudio-head-madmen.gif")
```

This data arrangement doesn't meet the rules of tidy data because there are two observations (i.e. multiple lead roles) in the same row.

Fortunately `tidyr` comes with a `separate_rows()` function I can use to move the two movie titles into their own rows. I'll set the `sep` argument to indicate I want to split these values at the semi-colon (`sep = ;`) and save these new data into `MadMenSepRows`.

```{r MadMenSepRows-rows, results='hide', eval=TRUE}
MadMenSepRows <- MadMen %>% 
    tidyr::separate_rows(lead_notes, sep = ";") 
MadMenSepRows %>% utils::head()
```

```{r IMAGE-separate-rows-madmen-head, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/MadMen-Separate-Rows.gif")
```

This separated the items in `lead_notes` into their own rows, but this also means all the other information on `LisaGay Hamilton` gets duplicated into a second row, too.

### How tidyr::separate_rows() works

```{r IMAGE-03.3-Separate-Rows, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03.3-Separate-Rows.png")
```

## Separating a column into multiple variables 

When I look at the `lead_notes` I see there are still two pieces of information in this variable: the title and the year (separated by a comma). I am going to use another `tidyr` function, `separate()`, to split these two into different *columns*. 

`tidyr::separate()` takes a `col` argument (the column I want to use to split), `into` (the new columns for the two bits of data), `sep` (what to split them on), and `remove` (a logical argument specifying whether to delete the original column). 

I'm going to run this code without assigning it to a new object to demonstrate how handy it is to work in RMarkdown/RStudio.

```{r separate-rows, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, results='hide', eval=TRUE}
MadMenSepRows %>% 
    tidyr::separate(col = lead_notes,  
                    into = c("lead_title", "lead_date"), 
                    sep = ", ", 
                    remove = FALSE)
```

```{r IMAGE-04-MadMen-Separate, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/04-MadMen-Separate.gif")
```

### Dealing with messages & warnings

When I ran the code above I got the following text in the output window,

`Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 1 rows [54].` 

Be sure to read all error & warning messages. Many times, if something doesn't work, the solution is right there in the message (*this is one of those cases.*) I will leave it as an exercise to understand what is happening with the `tidyr::separate()` message. 

Now that I know this function is working, I will assign this to a new object called, `MadMenSeparated`. 

```{r MadMenSeparated, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
MadMenSeparated <- MadMenSepRows %>% 
    tidyr::separate(col = lead_notes,  
                    into = c("lead_title", "lead_date"), 
                    sep = ", ", 
                    remove = FALSE)
```

### How tidyr::separate() works

```{r IMAGE-04.1-MadMen-Separate, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/04.1-MadMen-Separate.png")
```

## Unite columns into new variables

Sometimes two columns need to be combined into a new, single variable. I'll demonstrate an example of this with the data behind the article, ["Where Police Have Killed Americans In 2015"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-police-have-killed-americans-in-2015/). 

These data are from the Guardian's [database](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/about-the-counted) on police killings, 

> "The Counted is a project by the Guardian – and you – working to count the number of people killed by police and other law enforcement agencies in the United States throughout 2015 and 2016."

The code below loads and views the `police_killings` data frame. 

```{r PoliceKillings}
PoliceKillings <- fivethirtyeight::police_killings
PoliceKillings %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

I want to `unite()` the `city` and `state` columns into a single column titled `city_state`. The new `city_state` column will include the name of the city and state, separated by a comma. Creating this column *does* violate the rules of tidy data, but a column like this might be helpful as a label on a graph. 

Just to be safe we will keep both the `city` and `state` variables in the `PoliceKillingsUnited` data set. 

```{r PoliceKillingsUnited, results='hide'}
PoliceKillingsUnited <- PoliceKillings %>% 
    tidyr::unite(col = city_state, # new variable name
     city, state, # columns I am using
     sep = ", ", # how to separated them
     remove = FALSE) # do not remove city and state 
PoliceKillingsUnited %>% dplyr::select(streetaddress:longitude) %>% head(3)
```

### How tidyr::unite() works

`tidyr::unit()` combines two columns into one. 

```{r IMAGE-05.1-PoliceKillingsUnited, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/05.1-PoliceKillingsUnited.png")
```


## Arrange data by a single column

Load the `murder_2015_final` data set into the workspace into an object called `Murder2015Final`. 

```{r load-data}
Murder2015Final <- fivethirtyeight::murder_2015_final
Murder2015Final %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

These data come from the article, [A Handful Of Cities Are Driving 2016’s Rise In Murders](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-handful-of-cities-are-driving-2016s-rise-in-murders/).

It's often helpful to sort or arrange your data before you make any changes to their structure. If you set the data up in a predictable way, it'll be easier to spot if any transformations go wrong or produce a result you weren't expecting. 

I am going to use `dplyr::arrange()` to sort the `Murder2015Final` data by `city` and rename them `MurdersArranged`. I'll print these to the RStudio Notebook `tibble` preview.  

```{r MurdersArranged, results='hide', eval=TRUE}
MurdersArranged <- Murder2015Final %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(city)
MurdersArranged %>% utils::head()
```

### How dplyr::arrange() works

`dplyr::arrange()` sorts a data frame by a single (or multiple) variables. 

```{r IMAGE-07-MurdersArranged, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/07-MurdersArranged.png")
```

## Gathering multiple variables into a single column

The `MurdersArranged` data has two variables that contain the number of murders in each state for 2014 and 2015 (`murders_2014` and `murders_2015`). I am going to `gather` up these variables into a single column I’ll name `murder_year`, and I’ll store the number of murders in a column titled `murders`. Both of these new variables will get stored in a new object titled `MurdersGathered`. 

I'll continue including `dplyr::arrange()` to see if I get a predictable result.

```{r MurdersGathered, results='hide', eval=TRUE}
MurdersGathered <- MurdersArranged %>% 
    tidyr::gather(
        key = murder_year,
        value = murders,
        murders_2014:murders_2015,
        na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(city)
MurdersGathered %>% utils::head()
```

### How dplyr::arrange() & tidyr::gather() works

The image below shows how the `tidyr::gather()` works on the arranged data. 

```{r IMAGE-07.1-MurdersGathered, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/07.1-MurdersGathered.png")
```

## Spreading a variable across columns

The opposite of `tidyr::gather()` is `tidyr::spread()`. This function works a lot like `tidyr::gather()`, because it takes the same `key` and `value` arguments, only this time it sends the contents on `murder_year` into two columns (only two different values are in this column), and the values from `murders` ends up beneath each new corresponding column. I'll put this into a new object named `MurderSpread`.

```{r MurderSpread, results='hide'}
MurderSpread <- MurdersGathered %>% 
    tidyr::spread(key = murder_year,
        value = murders
        ) %>% 
        dplyr::arrange(
            city)
MurderSpread %>% utils::head()
```

```{r IMAGE-07.6-MurderSpread.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/07.6-MurderSpread.png")
```
