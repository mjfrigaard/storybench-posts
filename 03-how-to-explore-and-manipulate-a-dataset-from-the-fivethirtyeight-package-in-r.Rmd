The `fivethirtyeight` R package – released by Albert Y. Kim, Chester Ismay, and Jennifer Chunn last March – contains dozens of datasets used in FiveThirtyEight news articles like [“A Handful Of Cities Are Driving 2016’s Rise In Murders,”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-handful-of-cities-are-driving-2016s-rise-in-murders/) [“The Best MLB All-Star Teams Ever,”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-mlb-all-star-teams-ever/) and [“The Dallas Shooting Was Among The Deadliest For Police In U.S. History.”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dallas-shooting-was-among-the-deadliest-for-police-in-u-s-history/) 

This tutorial will explore the `murder_2015_final` dataset using `tidyr` functions like `tibble`, `gather`, `arrange` and `separate` from our tidyverse tutorial.

## Install and load the package

Using RStudio, we’ll install and then load the `fivethirtyeight` package, as well as `tidyr`, `tibble` and `dplyr` and then call `murder_2015_final`


```{r packages}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
murder_2015_final
```


Look at the dataset’s column names

Use `names(murder_2015_final)` to list out the dataset’s column names.

```{r names-murder_2015_final}
names(murder_2015_final)
```

```{r 03-01-names538, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03-01-names538.png")
```


### Gather variables into a single column

Lets gather up the two year variables, `murders_2014` and `murders_2015` into a single year column we’ll name `murder_year`. We’ll store the number of murders in a column titled murders and call this new object `murders_gathered`.

```{r murders_gathered, results='hide'}
murders_gathered <- murder_2015_final %>% 
    gather(
        murder_year,
        murders,
        murders_2014:murders_2015,
        na.rm = TRUE)
murders_gathered
```

```{r 03-02-names538, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03-02-names538.png")
```


### Arrange data alphabetically by state and city

Now let’s `arrange` these data alphabetically by state and city. We can do this with `dplyr::arrange()` from the `dplyr` package. (We’ll learn more about `dplyr` in the next tutorial!)


```{r murders_arranged, results='hide'}
murders_arranged <- murders_gathered %>% 
    arrange(
        state, 
        city)
murders_arranged
```

So now we have the two years in a single column (`murder_year`), but the repeating `murder_` text is redundant. I want to get the year in a column by itself.

```{r 03-03-names538, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03-03-names538.png")
```

### Separate “murder_year” column into “text” and “year”

Now I want to put the murder years (`2014` & `2015`) back into two different columns. I’ll do this with `tidyr::separate()`.

The `separate()` command uses a name of the existting column we want to separate (`murder_year`), and the names of the columns that will contain the separated values (`c("text", "year")`).

```{r murders_separate}
murders_separate <- murders_arranged %>%
    tidyr::separate(
        murder_year,
            into = c("text", 
                     "year"))
murders_separate
```

Great. Now I can use `tidyr::spread()` to put the year back into two different columns, 2014 & 2015. But I will combine this with `dplyr::arrange()` so the output is easier to read.

```{r murders_spread, results='hide'}
murders_spread <- murders_separate %>% 
    spread(
        year,
        murders
        ) %>% 
        arrange(
            state,
            city)
murders_spread
```

```{r 03-04-names538, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03-04-names538.png")
```

What if I want to combine city and state into a single column `city_state`?

### Using unite to paste one column into another

The final command, `tidyr::unite()`, lets me paste the contents of columns onto one another. It requires the name of the new column `city_state` and the columns I want to combine city and state. But I want to sort this new tibble in descending order of change, and I want to remove the text variable.

I can combine all of these together with the pipe (`%>%`).

```{r murders_final}
murders_final <- murders_spread %>%
unite(
    city_state, 
    city, 
    state) %>% 
        arrange(
            city_state
            ) %>% 
            select(
                -(text)
                )
murders_final
```

## Output the new table as a csv

Use `readr::write_csv(as_data_frame(murders_final), "murders_final.csv")` and voilá, you have a csv.

```{r 03-05-names538, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03-05-names538.png")
```

### A recap of what we learned

We used the pipe operator to string together various `tidyr` and `dplyr` functions for structuring our data (in tibbles). Remember that:

`gather()` collects data across columns and puts it into into rows
`arrange()` sorts the data in each column
`separate()` divides the contents of a column apart into new columns
`spread()` distributes data from rows into columns
`unite()` attaches the contents from one column onto the contents of another column


```{r 03-tidyr-image-full, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03-tidyr-image-full.png")
```

### A quick barplot

By typing `barplot(murders_final$change)`, you can create a quick barplot of the change in murders by city.

```{r barplot}
graphics::barplot(murders_final$change)
```

Obviously, the barplot is not visualizing the “change” column sorted low to high. To do that, try your hand with `arrange()`.

```{r murders_final_sort}
murders_final  %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(change) -> murders_final_sort
```

Then, plotting `barplot(murders_final_sort$change)` will produce this:

```{r murders_final_sort-change}
barplot(murders_final_sort$change)
```

To extend the y-axis to -20, add:

```{r add-yaxis}
barplot(murders_final_sort$change,
        ylim = c(-20, 120))
```


Finally, we’ll add some labels. There are many different ways to add labels in R. Here’s one way:


```{r midpts}
midpts <- barplot(murders_final_sort$change,
                  cex.axis = 1.0, cex.names = 0.6,
                  ylim = c(-20, 120), main = "Change in murders from 2014 to 2015"
)

text(murder_2015_final$city,
     x = midpts,
     offset = -0.1,
     y = -20,
     cex = 0.5,
     srt = 60,
     xpd = TRUE,
     pos = 2
) 
```
