# Getting Started in RStudio Notebooks

R is a powerful statistical programming language for manipulating, graphing, and modeling data. One of the major positive aspects of R is that it's open-source (free). But "free" in this case does not necessarily mean "easy." Learning to program in R is time-consuming and occasionally frustrating, but, fortunately, the number of helpful tools and packages is always growing.

## Enter RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that streamlines the R programming workflow into an easy to read layout. RStudio also includes useful tools (referred to as packages) for data manipulation (`dplyr`), cleaning (`tidyr`), visualizations (`ggplot2`), report writing (`rmarkdown` & `knitr`), and publishing to the web (`shiny` & `ggviz`).  

Just like R, RStudio is free. They've also recently released [R Markdown Notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html), a seamless integration of code, plain text, and results that can be exported into PDF, .docx, or HTML formatted files. 

## Getting started

Start out by installing [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and RStudio (you'll need the preview version [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/))

If you need help installing R or RStudio, please see [this installation guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9TJWYEwUKuSMW5mSEhrYWREQmM/view).

The IDE environment has four panes (seen below), 


```{r 01-studio-setup, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls(".", regexp = "rstudio_setup")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/01-rstudio_setup.png")
```


As you can see, the upper-left pane is the **editor**. The pane in the upper-right, where it says "*Environment is empty*," will show the working dataset. The lower-left pane is called the **console**, which runs the R code. And the pane in the bottom-right will display my **results**.

To get a better understanding of the RStudio IDE, check out this tutorial from [Princeton](http://dss.princeton.edu/training/RStudio101.pdf).

## Opening a New Notebook

To get started, click on "**File**" > "**New File**" > "**R Notebook**". R Notebooks automatically start off with a title and some sample code. The header is written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), which stands is used to configure the R markdown document. The rest of the file is written in R Markdown, an R-flavored version of the markdown [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). To see how the code snippets is woven into the .html, save the file and click on the small "Play" arrow button right above "Run Current Chunk." 



```{r 02-play-button, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/02-play-button.png")
```


```{r 03-preview-button, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls(".")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/03-preview-button.png")
```


R Notebook, as you can see, can generate an Html preview of your R Notebook file that does a great job of combining markdown text, R code, and results in a clean, crisp, easy-to-share finished product.

## Getting started with R: syntax, numbers and text

You can use RStudio as a calculator. Type 2 + 2 directly into the console and press enter. You should see this:

```{r ex-1}
2 + 2
```

What is the `[1]`? This is the row number for our printed result. 

You’re probably hoping to use RStudio for something slightly more advanced than simple arithmetic. Fortunately R can calculate and store multiple values in variables to reference later. This is done with the `<-` assignment operator:

Now, put the same `2 + 2` up in the upper-left editor pane. Notice that all R code must have a \``` and {r} before it and a \``` after it. Add that by clicking *Insert* and "R".

You're probably hoping to use RStudio for something slightly more advanced than simple arithmetic. Fortunately, R can calculate and store multiple values in **variables** to reference later. This is done with the `<-` assignment operator. Type the following and hit enter. 

```{r ex-2}
x <- 2 + 2
```

Notice the a Values table appear in the **working environment** – or workspace – pane listing x as 4. (The `<-` is similar to the `=` sign. In fact, the `=` sign does the same thing, but the typical convention in R is the `<-`.)

To see the contents of `x`, enter it into the console and press enter. You'll see:

```{r ex-3}
x
```

You can also perform mathematical operations with variables. Store `4 + 4` in a variable called `y` and add it the variable `x`

```{r y-and-x}
y <- 4 + 4
y + x
```

R identifies numbers and text – or "string" - characters. Text can also be stored into variables using the `<-` symbol and quotations.  

```{r a-and-b}
a <- "human"
b <- "error"
```

Notice, as you add more values to your dataset, they'll appear in the upper-right pane.

## Basic manipulation of strings in R

Text strings are stored differently than numerical data in R. The commands used to manipulate strings are also slightly different.

If you want to combine two strings, use the `paste` function:

```{r paste}
paste(a, b)
```

## Objects and data structures in R

R is an **object oriented** programming language, which means it recognizes and works on **objects** according to their structure and type. The most common objects in R are **atomic vectors** and **lists**.

### Atomic Vectors 1.1: numeric and integer vectors

Numeric vectors include "real" numbers with decimal places, while integers are whole numbers. To create numeric vectors, use the `c()` function which stands for concatenating (a term for combining that you may know from Excel). 

Below is an example of a numeric vector of odd numbers less than 10:

```{r odd_vect}
odd_vect <- c(1.3, 3.3, 5.5, 7.7, 9.9)
```

This statement is saying, "*combine these five numbers into a vector and call it `odd_vect`*"


If I want to create an integer (or whole number) vector, I need to follow each number with an `L`

The assignment operator also works in the other direction. Use it to create another numeric vector named `even_vect` of even integers less than or equal to 10.

```{r even_vect}
c(2L, 4L, 6L, 8L, 10L) -> even_vect
```


The `c()` function works for combining separate numerical vectors, too.  Add these two variables together into a new vector called `ten_vect` and print the contents:

```{r ten_vect}
ten_vect <- c(odd_vect, even_vect)
ten_vect
```

The final numeric vector (`ten_vect`) has combined *both* the odd *and* even values into a single vector. See it in the upper-right working dataset pane.

### Atomic vectors 1.2: logical and character vectors

Logical vectors return two possible values, `TRUE` or `FALSE`. We can use `logic` to interrogate vectors in order to discover their type.

For example, we can use `is.numeric` to figure out if the `ten_vect` vector we created ended up being numeric or integer.

```{r is.numeric}
is.numeric(ten_vect)
```

Why did the combination of a numerical and integer vector end up being numeric? This is referred to as `coercion`. When a less flexible data type (numeric) is combined with a more flexible data type (integer), the more flexible element is `coerced` into the less flexible type. 

### Atomic vector 1.3: character vectors

In R, character vectors contain text strings. We can use character vectors to construct a sentence using a combination of `c()` and `<-` functions.
We will start with a *preposition*:

```{r prep_vect}
prep_vect <- c("In")
```

then include a *noun*

```{r noun_vect}
noun_vect <- c("the Brothers Karamazov,")
```

throw in a *subject*, 

```{r sub_vect}
sub_vect <- c("Dmitri")
```

sprinkle in a *verb*, 

```{r verb_vect}
verb_vect <- c("kills")
```

and finish with an *object*

```{r obj_vect}
obj_vect <- c("his father")
```


Sentence construction can be a great way to learn how vector objects are structured in R. **Atomic** **vectors** are always flat, so you can nest them all…

```{r sent_vect}
sent_vect <- c("In",c("the Brothers Karamazov,",c("Dmitri",c("kills",c("his father")))))
sent_vect
```


Or enter them directly:

```{r directly}
c("In","the Brothers Karamazov", "Dmitri", "kills", "his father")
```


Both return the same result.

Finally, we can combine each part of the sentence together using `paste`:

```{r paste-sent_vect}
sent_vect <- paste(prep_vect, noun_vect, sub_vect, verb_vect, obj_vect)
sent_vect
```

## Lists

Unlike vectors – which only contain elements of a single type – lists can contain elements of different types.

We will create a list that includes an integer vector (`even_vect`) a logical vector (`TRUE`, `FALSE`), a full sentence (`sent_vect`), and a numeric vector (`odd_vect`) and we will call it `my_list`

```{r my_list}
my_list <- list(even_vect, c(TRUE, FALSE), c(sent_vect), c(odd_vect))
```

```{r str-my_list}
str(my_list)
```

Lists can even contain other lists.

```{r list-lists_on}
lists_on <- list(list(list(list())))
str(lists_on)
```

This feature separates Lists from the Atomic vectors described above.

So there you have it! This how-to should give you some basics in R programming. You can save it as HTML, pdf, or Docx file for future reference.
