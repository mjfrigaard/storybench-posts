# Setting up access to the YouTube API

Head over to the [`tuber`](https://soodoku.github.io/tuber/articles/tuber-ex.html) package website. Make sure you install the package and load it with `library()`

```{r install-tuber, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tuber")
library(tuber) # youtube API
library(magrittr) # Pipes %>%, %T>% and equals(), extract().
library(tidyverse) # all tidyverse packages
library(hrbrthemes) # themes for graphs
```

[Gaurav Sood](https://www.gsood.com/) wrote an excellent, easy-to-use package for accessing YouTube data. If you're like me, you love screenshots for setting up new tools like this. 

Below is a quick outline for the steps to get your application id and password set up in R.

## Get the application 

First head over to your [Google APIs dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) (you'll need an account for this). Click on "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES".

```{r 32-00-google-api, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-00-google-api.png")
```

Click on the search bar and type in YouTube and you should see four options. Enable all of them.


```{r 32-01-youtube-api, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-01-youtube-api.png")
```

**IMPORTANT** you will also have to enable the Freebase API.

## Create credentials 

After these have been enabled, you'll need to create credentials for the API. Click on the Credentials label on the left side of your Google dashboard (there should be a little key icon next to it).

```{r 32-02-google-api-credentials, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-02-google-api-credentials.png")
# 32-03-create-credentials.png
```

After clicking on the Credentials icon, you'll need to select the OAuth client ID option. 

```{r 32-03-create-credentials.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-03-create-credentials.png")
# 32-03-create-credentials.png
```

### Name your application

This is where we name the app and indicate it is an "Other" Application type. 

```{r 32-04-create-youtube-api-r, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-04-create-youtube-api-r.png")
```

We are told we are limited to 100 sensitive scope log ins unit the OAuth consent screen is published. 

```{r 32-05-oauth-cred-google, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-05-oauth-cred-google.png")
```

Click on the copy icons and save them as 

```r
client_id <- "20939048240-snjuunf5kp1n788b4gvi84khk553u36f.apps.googleusercontent.com"
client_secret <- "O9eT8Q_ldnivnvopqkvJd32Hv"
```

## Authenticate your application

Now you can run the `tuber::yt_oauth()` function to authenticate the application. I included the token as a blank string because it kept looking for the `.httr-oauth` in my local directory. 

```{r yt_oauth, eval=FALSE}
# use the youtube oauth 
yt_oauth(app_id = client_id,
         app_secret = client_secret,
         token = '')
```

This will open your browser and ask you to sign into the Google account you set everything up with. You should see the name of your application in place of "*Your application name*".

```{r 32-06-sign-in-with-youtube, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-06-sign-in-with-youtube.png")
```

After signing in, you'll be asked if the YouTube application your created can access your Google account. If you approve, click "Allow".

```{r 32-07-google-credentials-allow.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-07-google-credentials-allow.png")
```

This should give you a blank page with a cryptic, `Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R.` message.

## Accessing YouTube data

Be sure to check out the [reference page](https://soodoku.github.io/tuber/reference/index.html) and the [YouTube API reference docs](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/) on how to access various meta data from YouTube videos.

Also check out the [previous post on using APIs](http://www.storybench.org/how-to-access-apis-in-r/).
