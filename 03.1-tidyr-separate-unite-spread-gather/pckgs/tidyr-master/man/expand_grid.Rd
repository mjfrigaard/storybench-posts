\title{Create a tibble from all combinations of inputs}
\usage{
expand_grid(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Name-value pairs. The name will become the column name in the
output.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one column for each input in \code{...}. The output
will have one row for each combination of the inputs (i.e. the size
be equal to the product of the sizes of the inputs).
}
\description{
Create a tibble from all combinations of inputs
}
\section{Compared to \link{expand.grid}}{

\itemize{
\item Varies the first element fastest.
\item Never converts strings to factors.
\item Does not add any additional attributes.
\item Returns a tibble, not a data frame.
\item Can expand any generalised vector, including data frames.
}
}

\examples{
expand_grid(x = 1:3, y = 1:2)
expand_grid(l1 = letters, l2 = LETTERS)

# Can also expand data frames
expand_grid(df = data.frame(x = 1:2, y = c(2, 1)), z = 1:3)
# And matrices
expand_grid(x1 = matrix(1:4, nrow = 2), x2 = matrix(5:8, nrow = 2))
