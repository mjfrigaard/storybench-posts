# Welcome to `StorybenchR` 

This is a series of tutorials from Data Journalism in R from [Storybench.org](http://www.storybench.org/category/data-journalism-in-r/) using the `tidyverse`. 

```{r tidyverse_logo, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crayon::strip_style(tidyverse::tidyverse_logo())
```

```{r tidyverse2.1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/tidyverse2.1.png")
```


All tutorials are listed below (in order). Some of these posts have been updated with current package usage/functions. In this case, the code for these tutorials might be different from what is in the Storybench post.
