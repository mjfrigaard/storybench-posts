# Welcome to `StorybenchR`

This is a series of tutorials from Data Journalism in R from [Storybench.org](http://www.storybench.org/category/data-journalism-in-r/) using the `tidyverse`. 

```{r tidyverse_logo, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crayon::strip_style(tidyverse::tidyverse_logo())
```
