# Setting up access to the YouTube API

It's even easier to access YouTube's metadata (views, likes, dislikes, comments, etc.) thanks to the [`tuber`](https://soodoku.github.io/tuber/articles/tuber-ex.html) package by [Gaurav Sood](https://www.gsood.com/). 

Make sure you `install` the package and load it with `library()`

```{r install-tuber-packages, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tuber")
library(tuber) # youtube API
library(magrittr) # Pipes %>%, %T>% and equals(), extract().
library(tidyverse) # all tidyverse packages
library(hrbrthemes) # themes for graphs
```

Sood wrote an excellent, easy-to-use package for accessing the YouTube data API. If you're like me, you love screenshots for setting up new tools like this. Below is a quick outline for the steps to get your application id and password set up in R.

## 1) Enable the APIs

First head over to your [Google APIs dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) (you'll need an account for this). Click on "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES".

```{r 32-00-google-api, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-00-google-api.png")
```

This will bring up a laundry list of APIs, but we only need the four pertaining to YouTube (see below) and the Freebase API. 

Click on the search bar and type in YouTube and you should see four options. Enable all of them.

```{r 32-01-youtube-api, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-01-youtube-api.png")
```

**IMPORTANT** you'll also have to search for and enable the Freebase API.

## 2) Create your credentials 

After these have been enabled, you'll need to create credentials for the API. Click on the Credentials label on the left side of your Google dashboard (there should be a little key icon next to it).

```{r 32-02-google-api-credentials, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-02-google-api-credentials.png")
# 32-03-create-credentials.png
```

After clicking on the Credentials icon, you'll need to select the OAuth client ID option. 

```{r 32-03-create-credentials.png, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-03-create-credentials.png")
# 32-03-create-credentials.png
```

### Create your OAuth 

This next step is where we'll name OAuth client ID and select the option for "Other" application type. 

```{r 32-04-create-youtube-api-r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-04-create-youtube-api-r.png")
```

We're told we're limited to 100 sensitive scope logins until the OAuth consent screen is published. That's not a problem for us, so we'll go ahead and copy both the client ID and client secret.

```{r 32-05-oauth-cred-google, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-05-oauth-cred-google.png")
```

After clicking on the copy icons, we will save both into two objects in RStudio (`client_id` and `client_secret`).

```r
client_id <- "20939048240-snjuunf5kp1n788b4gvi84khk553u36f.apps.googleusercontent.com"
client_secret <- "O9eT8Q_ldnivnvopqkvJd32Hv"
```

## 3) Authenticate the application

Now we can run `tuber`'s `yt_oauth()` function to authenticate the application. We've included the token as a blank string (`token = ''`) because the function kept looking for the `.httr-oauth` file in our local directory (but we didn't create one).


```{r yt_oauth}
# use the youtube oauth 
tuber::yt_oauth(app_id = client_id,
         app_secret = client_secret,
         token = '')
```

Provided we did everything correct, `tuber::yt_oauth()` *should* prompt the following message in the R console: 

```
Use a local file ('.httr-oauth'), to cache OAuth access credentials between R sessions?

1: Yes
2: No
```

Select `2` and your internet browser should open up and ask you to sign into the Google account you set everything up with (see the images below). You'll see the name of your application in place of "*Your application name*".

```{r 32-06-sign-in-with-youtube, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-06-sign-in-with-youtube.png")
```

After signing in, you'll be asked if the YouTube application you created can access your Google account. If you approve, click "Allow".

```{r 32-07-google-credentials-allow.png, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_tree("figs", regex = "32")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/32-07-google-credentials-allow.png")
```

After clicking "Allow", the browser should give you a blank page with a cryptic, `Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R.` message.

# Accessing YouTube data

Great! Now that we're all set up, we will download some data into RStudio. Be sure to check out the [reference page](https://soodoku.github.io/tuber/reference/index.html) and the [YouTube API reference docs](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/) on how to access various meta data from YouTube videos.

We'll download some example data from [Dave Chappelle's comedy central playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HoeSC3raE-EB8r_vVDOs-59kg3Spvd), which is a collection of 200 of his most popular skits. 

## Downloading the playlist data

We will be using the playlist id from the url to access the content from the videos. Here is some information on the playlistId parameter:

> The `playlistId` parameter specifies the unique ID of the playlist for which you want to retrieve playlist items. Note that even though this is an optional parameter, every request to retrieve playlist items must specify a value for either the `id` parameter or the `playlistId` parameter.

Dave Chappelle's playlist is in the url below. We pass it to the `stringr::str_split()` function to get the `playlistId` out of it.

```{r dave_chappelle_playlist_id-bill_burr_playlist_id}
dave_chappelle_playlist_id <- stringr::str_split(
    string = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HoeSC3raE-EB8r_vVDOs-59kg3Spvd", 
    pattern = "=", 
    n = 2,
    simplify = TRUE)[ , 2]
dave_chappelle_playlist_id
```

```r
[1] "PLG6HoeSC3raE-EB8r_vVDOs-59kg3Spvd"
```


Ok--we have created a vector for Dave Chappelle's playlistId from the url, now we can use the `tuber::get_playlist_items()` to collect the videos into a `data.frame`. 

```{r DaveChappelleRaw}
DaveChappelleRaw <- tuber::get_playlist_items(filter = c(playlist_id = "PLG6HoeSC3raE-EB8r_vVDOs-59kg3Spvd"), 
                                              part = "contentDetails",
                                              # set this to the number of videos
                                              max_results = 200) 
```


We should check these data to see if there is one row per video from the playlist (recall that Dave Chappelle had 200 videos).

```{r DaveChappelleRaw-glimpse}
# check the data for Dave Chappelle
DaveChappelleRaw %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

```r
Observations: 200
Variables: 6
$ .id                             <chr> "items1", "items2", "items3", "item…

$ contentDetails.videoPublishedAt <fct> 2019-04-28T16:00:07.000Z, 2017-12-3…
```

## Collecting statistics from a YouTube playlist 

Now that we have all of the video `ids` (not `.id`), we can create a function that extracts the statistics for each video on the playlist. We'll start by putting the video ids in a vector and call it `dave_chap_ids`.

```{r dave_chap_ids}
dave_chap_ids <- base::as.vector(DaveChappelleRaw$contentDetails.videoId)
dplyr::glimpse(dave_chap_ids)
```

```r
chr [1:200] "oO3wTulizvg" "ZX5MHNvjw7o" "MvZ-clcMCec" "4trBQseIkkc" ...
```

`tuber` has a `get_stats()` function we will use with the vector we just created for the show ids. 

```{r get_all_stats}
# Function to scrape stats for all vids
get_all_stats <- function(id) {
  tuber::get_stats(video_id = id)
} 
```

Now we introduce a bit of iteration from [the `purrr` package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/). The `purrr` package provides tools for 'functional programming', but that is a much bigger topic for a later post. 

For now, just know that the `purrr::map_df()` function takes an object as .`x`, and whatever function is listed in `.f` gets applied over the `.x` object. Check out the code below:

```{r DaveChappelleAllStatsRaw}
# Get stats and convert results to data frame 
DaveChappelleAllStatsRaw <- purrr::map_df(.x = dave_chap_ids, 
                                          .f = get_all_stats)
```

```{r DaveChappelleAllStatsRaw-glimpse}
DaveChappelleAllStatsRaw %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

```r
Observations: 200
Variables: 6
$ id            <chr> "oO3wTulizvg", "ZX5MHNvjw7o", "MvZ-clcMCec", "4trBQse…
$ viewCount     <chr> "4446789", "19266680", "6233018", "8867404", "7860341…
$ likeCount     <chr> "48699", "150691", "65272", "92259", "56584", "144625…
$ dislikeCount  <chr> "1396", "6878", "1530", "2189", "1405", "3172", "1779…
$ favoriteCount <chr> "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"…
$ commentCount  <chr> "2098", "8345", "5130", "5337", "2878", "9071", "4613…
```

Fantastic! We have the `DaveChappelleRaw` and `DaveChappelleAllStatsRaw` in two `data.frame`s we can export (and timestamp!)

```{r export-data}
# export DaveChappelleRaw
readr::write_csv(x = as.data.frame(DaveChappelleRaw), 
                 path = paste0("data/", 
                               base::noquote(lubridate::today()),
                               "-DaveChappelleRaw.csv"))
# export DaveChappelleRaw
readr::write_csv(x = as.data.frame(DaveChappelleAllStatsRaw), 
                 path = paste0("data/", 
                               base::noquote(lubridate::today()),
                               "-DaveChappelleAllStatsRaw.csv"))
# verify
fs::dir_ls("data", regexp = "Dave")
```
